## What Should It Be Called?

If you please, call it "Γραφή סֵ֫פֶר" correctly.

"Γραφή" means a writing, passage of scripture or the scriptures in biblical Greek, and "סֵ֫פֶר" means a missive, document, writing or book in biblical Hebrew. "Γραφή סֵ֫פֶר" is named after the Bible of its purpose.

Instead, "Graphé Sepher" must be more readable for most people in the modern global community.

If your charset dosen't have "é" called LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+00E9), "Graphe Sepher" may be also good.

And, if " " or space (U+0020) is disallowed, "Graphe_Sepher", "Graphe-Sepher" or "GrapheSepher" may be also acceptable.

If you have to spell it in just only upper case, it may be done this way: "GRAPHE SEPHER", "GRAPHE_SEPHER", "GRAPHE-SEPHER" or "GRAPHESEPHER".

And if lower case: "graphe sepher", "graphe_sepher", "graphe-sepher" or "graphesepher".
